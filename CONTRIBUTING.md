# What is Edge?

`Edge` is a simple theme with bright colors. Edge comes in 3 versions — *Edge Night Sky*, *Edge Ocean* and *Edge Serene* for all day long comfortable work.

I've designed Edge with a multi-editor process in mind, so that the same theme can be reused on multiple editors, including .

As such, the process implies all development work to be done in [the main repo](https://github.com/tricinel/edge-theme), where I have setup a bunch of tasks to make development easy.

Please check the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/tricinel/edge-theme/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) file there.
